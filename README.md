# My OpenGL experiments
This repository contains several small projects I developed while learning OpenGL

## Requirements
- building tools (all the subprojects use cmake)
- GLFW to deal with OpenGL context creation and input device mangement
- GLAD to bind to the GPU's OpenGL capabilities

### GLFW install
I encountered some problem with inputs related to the binary package of glfw shipped by my package manager, so I donwloaded and built the GLFW library from source.
Just clone the [repo](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and follow the instructions.
